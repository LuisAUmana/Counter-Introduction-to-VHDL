# Counter-Introduction-to-VHDL
Assignment provided by Introduction to VHDL (ECGR 4146)

In this lab, you will design a counter that circulates through a sequence. Instead of using all possible states as discussed in lecture 9-UNCC-VHDL-Lecture6-Sequential Circuits -Free-Running Binary Counter, which counts from 0-15, sometimes it is required to have a counter to circulate through a subset of the states.

a) Implement a counter whose state circulates from 0 to m-1 and then repeats. Example: 0-12

b) Implement a counter whose state circulates from n to m-1 and then repeats. Example: 6-15

Deliverables:

PDF that includes VHDL codes, Testbench and the simulation waveforms for the counter implemented for part a and b.
